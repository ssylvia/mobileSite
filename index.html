            <div class="menuContent">Story maps use the concepts and tools of geography to tell stories about the world. They combine intelligent Web maps with text, multimedia content, and intuitive user experiences to inform, educate, entertain, and inspire people about a wide variety of topics. Most story maps are designed for non-technical audiences.<br><br>Story maps are at the focal point of the rapid evolution of GIS from a technology available primarily to highly-trained specialists to an array of services and resources that can benefit everyone.</div>

He programmed his first web mapping application circa 1996 in MapObjects IMS, and he has been programming web applications ever since. He has seen many innovations over the years (XML, JavaScript, ASP.Net, SVG, SOAP, REST, PHP), and he is still riding the bull. Currently, Lee spends most of his time programming in Adobe Flex.<br><br><strong>David Asbury</strong> joined Esri in February 2011 after six years as a cartographer and GIS analyst at the Center for Ecosystem Management and Restoration in Oakland, CA where he worked on atlases depicting the geographic distribution of endangered steelhead trout. He received his Bachelors of Science degree in GIS and Computer Cartography at the University of Maryland and is an active member of the Society for Conservation GIS (SCGIS) and the North American Cartographic Information Society (NACIS).<br><br><strong>Stephen Sylvia</strong> began working with the Esriâ€™s Map Stories team in the summer of 2011 after graduating from Penn State.
