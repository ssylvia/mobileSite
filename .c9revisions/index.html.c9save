He came to Esri in late 2010 after 27 years at the National Geographic Society, where he told stories with maps in National Geographic magazine, in three editions of its Atlas of the World, and in countless wall maps and websites.<br>\r\n            <a rel=\"external\" href=\"mailto:acarroll@esri.com\">Email Allen &gt;</a>\r\n            <br>\r\n            <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/AllenCarroll\">Follow Allen on Twitter &gt;</a>\r\n            <br><br><strong>Lee Bock</strong> arrived at Esri, wide-eyed and wet behind the ears, in 1992. He programmed his first web mapping application circa 1996 in MapObjects IMS, and he has been programming web applications ever since. He has seen many innovations over the years (XML, JavaScript, ASP.Net, SVG, SOAP, REST, PHP), and he is still riding the bull. Currently, Lee spends most of his time programming in Adobe Flex.<br><br><strong>David Asbury</strong> joined Esri in February 2011 after six years as a cartographer and GIS analyst at the Center for Ecosystem Management and Restoration in Oakland, CA where he worked on atlases depicting the geographic distribution of endangered steelhead trout. He received his Bachelors of Science degree in GIS and Computer Cartography at the University of Maryland and is an active member of the Society for Conservation GIS (SCGIS) and the North American Cartographic Information Society (NACIS).<br><br><strong>Stephen Sylvia</strong> began working with the Esri's story map team in the summer of 2011 after graduating from Penn State. He has experience creating maps through ArcGIS desktop and is currently working to bring story maps to the web environment with ArcGIS Online and custom JavaScript applications</div>\r\n            <div class=\"menuHeader twitterLink\">Follow us on Twitter<span class=\"toggleIcon twitterIcon\">&nbsp;</span></div>\r\n            <div class=\"menuHeader emailLink\">Contact us<span class=\"toggleIcon mailIcon\">&nbsp;</span></div>\r\n        </div><!--/homePage-->\r\n\r\n    </body>\r\n</html>"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":4784}]],"length":4784}
